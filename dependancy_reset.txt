Perfect! You can save this **clean setup process** as a “ready-to-go” **React Native Expo deep-check and reset guide** for any future project. Here's a full **step-by-step reusable guide** you can keep:

---

### 🔹 1. Backup Current Project (Optional)

```bash
cp -r "C:\Users\Jidnesh\Desktop\Projects\New folder\mobile\client" "C:\Users\Jidnesh\Desktop\Projects\New folder\mobile\client_backup"
```

---

### 🔹 2. Replace `package.json` with clean version

* Use the minimal `package.json` I gave earlier.
* Save it in the project root (`client/package.json`).

---

### 🔹 3. Remove old dependencies and lock files

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

---

### 🔹 4. Install dependencies safely

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

---

### 🔹 5. Clear Expo cache and start project

```bash
expo start -c
```

---

### 🔹 6. Optional: Deep scan dependencies used in project

If you want to **check which dependencies are actually used**:

1. Install depcheck globally:

```bash
npm install -g depcheck
```

2. Run depcheck **from your project folder**:

```bash
depcheck .
```

* This scans **only the folder you are in**.
* It lists:

  * `dependencies` being used
  * `devDependencies` being used
  * `missing` (used but not installed)
  * `unused` (installed but not used)

---

### 🔹 7. Fix any missing dependencies

* For any **missing dependencies** reported by depcheck:

```bash
npm install <package-name> --save
```

* For devDependencies:

```bash
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```

---

### 🔹 8. Optional: Save this as reusable script

Create a file like `resetProject.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `resetProject.bat` (Windows) with the above commands, so next time you can run it in **one go**.

---

If you want, I can **write this exact reusable Windows batch file** (`resetProject.bat`) for your React Native Expo projects.
It will handle **clean install, depcheck, cache clear** in one command.

Do you want me to make that?
